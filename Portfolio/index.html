  <h1> About Me </h1>
          Hello! My Name is Bella. I was born and raised in New York but my Cameroonian Culture has
          shaped me to who I am today.
          I love to sing, dance, act and model
        I am also a member the Step Team and Track Tea of my school.
      In a addition I am a praise dancer at the luturgical dance group at my Church
      I listen to various types of music but the genres which i find most pleasing are Afro Pop,
      R&B, Pop and at times Jazz. This brings me to the  next fun fact about me; I am a musician and
      I play the Alto saxophone. I have been playing this insrument for about 7 Years. Music is a huge part of my life
      and my love for t begen to prosper since I was a Child. This is primarily because of my Cameroonian culture, in which
      music is very prevalent.
       <h2>Cameroon</h2>
       Cameroon is a country in West and Central Africa. It shares land borders
       with Nigeria in the east, Chad and the Central african Republic in the west, Gabon and the African
       Republic of Congo in the West. Cameroon is describes as "Africa in miniature" by virtue of its diverse geography.
       Cameroon exhibits all the major climates and vegetations of the entire African Continent:desert, rain forest, savanna,
       grassland, ocean coastland, and mountains. It has the tallest mountain in Wet Africa, Mount Cameroon. The Nation can be divided
       into five geographic zones. In addition, in Cameroon there are about 230 indigenous languages.
       Cameroon was colonized by France and Great Britain
       but eventually French Cameroon gained Independance from France on January 1, 1960 and
       English Cameroon gained independance from Great Britian on October 1, 1961.
       In Cameroon there are about 230 indigenous languages. In Cameroon Family is Golden and
       one miust always respet their elders. In Cameroon along with the rest of Africa there is a saying "It takes village to raise a child"
       and I witnessed this while growing up because the nurturing of a child is a family affair in the sense that every one played a vital
       role in the teaching segment and istallation of morals and values.
